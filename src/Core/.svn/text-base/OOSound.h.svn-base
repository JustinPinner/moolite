OOSound.h

Dispatch header to select the appropriate implementation of OOSound.

Add new OS imports here. The -DOS_NAME flag in the GNUmakefile
will select which one gets compiled.


== Overview of Oolite sound architecture ==
There are four public sound classes:
* OOSound: represents a sound, i.e. some data that can be played.
* OOMusic: subclass of OOSound with support for looping, and the special
           constraint that only one OOMusic may play at a time.
* OOSoundSource: a thing that can play a sound. Each sound played is
           conceptually played through a sound source, although this can be
		   implicit using OOSound's -play method.
* OOSoundReferencePoint: a point in space relative to which a sound source is
           positioned. Since positional sound is not implemented, this serves
		   no practical purpose.
