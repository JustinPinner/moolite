OOWeakReference.h

Weak reference class for Cocoa/GNUstep/OpenStep. As it stands, this will not
work as a weak reference in a garbage-collected environment.

A weak reference allows code to maintain a reference to an object while
allowing the object to reach a retain count of zero and deallocate itself.
To function, the referenced object must implement the OOWeakReferenceSupport
protocol.

Client use is extremely simple: to get a weak reference to the object, call
-weakRetain and use the returned proxy instead of the actual object. When
finished, release the proxy. Messages sent to the proxy will be forwarded as
long as the underlying object exists; beyond that, they will act exactly like
messages to nil. (IMPORTANT: this means messages returning floating-point or
struct values have undefined return values, so use -weakRefUnderlyingObject in
such cases.) Example:

@interface ThingWatcher: NSObject
{
@private
	Thing			*thing;
}
@end

@implementation ThingWatcher
- (void)setThing:(Thing *)aThing
{
	[thing release];
	thing = [aThing weakRetain];
}

- (void)frobThing
{
	[thing frob];
}

- (void)dealloc
{
	[thing release];
	[super dealloc];
}
@end


Note that the only reference to OOWeakReference being involved is the call to
weakRetain instead of retain. However, the following would not work:
	thing = aThing;
	[thing weakRetain];

Additionally, it is not possible to access instance variables directly -- but
then, that's a filthy habit.

OOWeakReferenceSupport implementation is also simple:

@interface Thing: NSObject <OOWeakReferenceSupport>
{
@private
	OOWeakReference		*weakSelf;
}
@end

@implementation Thing
- (id)weakRetain
{
	if (weakSelf == nil)  weakSelf = [OOWeakReference weakRefWithObject:self];
	return [weakSelf retain];
}

- (void)weakRefDied:(OOWeakReference *)weakRef
{
	if (weakRef == weakSelf)  weakSelf = nil;
}

- (void)dealloc
{
	[weakSelf weakRefDrop];	// Very important!
	[super dealloc];
}

- (void)frob
{
	NSBeep();
}
@end
