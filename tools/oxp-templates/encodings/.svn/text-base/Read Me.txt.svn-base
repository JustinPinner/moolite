These OXPs change the font and text encoding of Oolite to support
additional languages. They are not intended to be used as-is, but rather to
be used as the basis for localizations (translations) of Oolite.
Modifications to the substitutions dictionary in oolite-font.plist may be
needed.

All five font textures (these, and the one in Oolite) are based on Apple's
version of Linotype Helvetica Bold, 50 pt.

The tool used to generate the images and can be found in the Oolite source
repository under tools/fonttexgen. This is a hacked-together tool for
Mac OS X 10.5 and later. It could be used to generate textures based on
other fonts, but would require modification.

These OXPs are hereby placed in the public domain.
