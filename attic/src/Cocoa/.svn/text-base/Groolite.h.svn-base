Groolite.h

Growl integration class. The singleton Groolite object listens for Growl
notifications and reports them by printing to the game communication log. For
more about Growl, see <http://growl.info>.

To do: reimplement using delegate pattern, remove dependency on Growl
framework headers (the framework is not needed at run time).
