These files contain download URLs for various dependencies. They are used
by the Mac OS X build system to download dependencies automatically (see
deps/Cocoa-deps/scripts). The first line must be an URL which can be
downloaded by curl and expanded by tar. Any additional lines will be
ignored. Currently, the second line is the original URL for files which are
mirrored.
