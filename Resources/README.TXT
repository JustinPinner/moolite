oolite-data
===========

This resources folder contains all the data that oolite needs when you run it - sounds,
textures, default settings, etc.

To modify sounds, textures and settings, use the AddOns directory, rather than modify
these files directly. For more information on how to do so, follow the guidelines found
at the following URL:

Or ask on Oolite's Bulletin Board:
