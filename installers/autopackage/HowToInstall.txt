.package Installation Instructions
----------------------------------
Start by uninstalling any Oolite (repository installation).
If you have already installed Oolite from a .package, it 
will be automatically uninstalled without affecting any of 
your save-games or add-ons.

Then execute the following:
(replace <package_name> with the actual name of the 
.package file - without the '<' and '>' characters)
	$ chmod u+x <package_name>.package
	$ ./<package_name>.package

Accept the download of the autopackage runtime and 
the GTK (needed only once). You will be prompted for 
a password with root privileges. If you don't provide it, 
the installation will be visible only to your user.

To remove oolite execute
(as root if you provided a password during installation)
	$ package remove oolite

Following the installation you may start Oolite from 
Games/Oolite menu or by executing:
	$ oolite
from a terminal.



Troubleshoot speech feature
---------------------------
If you encounter issues with the oolite speech feature,
you could try one of the following workarounds:
1. If your system has libportaudio.so.2 installed:
        cd [/usr or ~/.local]/lib/Oolite/oolite-deps/lib/
        [sudo] mv libportaudio.so.2 libportaudio.so.2.oolite
Note: If libportaudio.so.2 is not part of your default installation,
you could get it from your distro's repository.

2. If your system is configured with PulseAudio:
        cd [/usr or ~/.local]/lib/Oolite/oolite-deps/lib/
        [sudo] cp -p libespeak.so.1 libespeak.so.1.portaudio
        [sudo] cp -p libespeak.so.1.pulseaudio libespeak.so.1
Note: If PulseAudio is not part of your default installation,
you could get it from your distro's repository.

In any case you may turn the speech synthesis off, 
from Oolite ingame options. For further assistance,

Documentation
-------------
Oolite documentation can be found in
(if password was not provided during installation)
~/.local/lib/Oolite/doc/
or
(if password was provided during installation)
/usr/lib/Oolite/doc/
Feel free to also visit the Oolite wiki http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Oolite_Main_Page



Oolite Expansion Packs (i.e. add-ons)
-------------------------------------
Create the AddOns folder:
   $ mkdir ~/.Oolite/AddOns/
and copy any add-on ".oxp" folder into ~/.Oolite/AddOns/

If you have installed Oolite system-wide, providing a password 
during installation, you may copy any add-on ".oxp" folder 
into /usr/lib/Oolite/AddOns/ making your add-ons available to
any user.



Oolite Paths
------------
Note: The root-path for Oolite installation is either
~/.local (if password was not provided during installation)
or
/usr (if password was provided during installation)

During the .package installation Oolite will create the following:
<root-path>/lib/Oolite/ (application folder for binaries, resources and documentation)
<root-path>/bin/oolite (this is what you execute to run Oolite)
<root-path>/bin/oolite-update (this is what you execute to update oolite)

Following the first run, Oolite will create:
~/.Oolite/ (logs and add-ons)
~/.Oolite/Logs/ (Latest.log and Previous.log text-files)
~/GNUstep/ (GNUstep defaults and caches)
~/oolite-saves/ (save-games and screenshots)

Following the first in-game screenshot taken (using the "*" key):
~/oolite-saves/snapshots/
will be created to store the in-game screenshot
